# Python Machine Learning Book

This repository contains my personal notes and code implementations of the book [Python Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Machine-Learning-scikit-learn-TensorFlow-dp-1789955750/dp/1789955750/ref=dp_ob_title_bk) by Sebastian Raschka. The book is a comprehensive guide to machine learning and deep learning with Python. It covers a wide range of topics including supervised and unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction, ensemble learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. The book also provides practical examples and code implementations using popular Python libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras.
